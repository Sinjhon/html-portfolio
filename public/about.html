<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born and brought up in Bangladesh now living in Copenhagen, Denmark. 
  I had 4 years working carrier in a well-known BPO company called Quantanite in 
  Bangladesh. I worked there as a senior associate and my responsibilities were 
  data analyzing, data uploading in the website backend, data mining, and searching 
  for leads for the sales campaign. I have also worked in telesales and customer 
  service for 3 years during my studies. I have completed my bachelor's in computer science. </p>

<p>I have worked in versatile sectors but I was always passionate about my work which 
  makes me more confident and gives me the ability to work individually. I always feel 
  thrilled to learn new things.</p>

<p>In my free time, I love to watch movies, listing to songs, or spend time with my 
  friends and family.</p>
